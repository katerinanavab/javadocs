## this Keyword

{:.highlight}
The keyword ``this`` can be used in a class to refer to the **current calling object**. 

The keyword `this` is sometimes used by programmers to _distinguish between variables_. Programmers can give the parameter variables the same names as the instance variables and this can distinguish them and avoid a naming conflict. 

For example, both the **instance variable** and the **parameter variable** are called `name` in the `Person` class below:

```java
// instance variables
private String name;

// constructor
public Person(String name) {
    // Set this object's instance variable name to the parameter variable name
    this.name = name;
}
```
> Here, ``this.variable`` is a way to indicate that we are referring to the **instance variables** of this object instead of **a local variable**.

{:.warning}
**Static methods** cannot refer to `this` or instance variables because they are called with the _classname_, not an object, so there is no `this` object.

The ``this`` variable can be used anywhere you would use an object variable! You can even _pass it to another method_ as an **argument**. 

**💬 DISCUSS:** Consider the classes below, ``Pay`` and ``Overtime``. What does this code print out? Trace through the code. Notice how the `this` `Pay` object is passed to the `Overtime` class constructor.

```java
public class Pay {
       private double pay;

       public Pay(double p) {
           pay = p;
       }

       public double getPay() {
           return pay;
       }

       public void calculatePayWithOvertime() {
           // this Pay object is passed to the Overtime constructor
           Overtime ot = new Overtime(this);
           pay = ot.getOvertimePay();
       }

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Pay myPay = new Pay(100.0);
           myPay.calculatePayWithOvertime();
           System.out.println(myPay.getPay());
       }
}
```
```java
public class Overtime {
       private double payWithOvertime;

       public Overtime(Pay p) {
           payWithOvertime = p.getPay() * 1.5;
       }

       public double getOvertimePay() {
           return payWithOvertime;
       }
}
```
> The ``Pay`` class declares an ``Overtime`` object and passes in ``this`` (the current ``Pay`` object) to its constructor which computes the overtime with respect to that ``Pay`` object.

Here is an image that shows how ``this``, ``myPay`` and ``p`` all refer to the **same object in memory**:

## ⭐️ Summary

- Within a **non-static method** or a constructor, the keyword `this` is a reference to the **current object**, the object whose method or constructor is being called.

- `this.instanceVariable` can be used to distinguish between this object's instance variables and local parameter variables that may have the same variable names.

- **Static methods** do not have a `this` reference.

- The `this` variable can be used anywhere you would use an object variable, even to pass it to another method as an argument.
