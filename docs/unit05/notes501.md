## Anatomy of a Java Class

In Unit 2, we learned to use **classes** and **objects** that are built-in to
Java or written by other programmers. In this unit, you will learn to _write your
own classes_ and make your own objects! Watch this video to review the concept of **Object-Oriented Programming**:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3cFiJnxUBY" target="_blank"><button class="btn">📺 VIDEO</button></a>

{:.highlight}
💡 Remember that a **class** in Java defines a _blueprint_ for creating objects. When
you create **objects**, you create new **instances** of that class and what you
can do with those instances is determined by what methods are defined in the
class.
> For example in Unit 2, we created ``yertle`` and ``myrtle``, 2 ``Turtle``
variables and assigned them references to objects created from the class
``Turtle`` and we used instances of Java’s ``String`` class to assign values to
different ``String`` variables.

### Creating a Class

Most classes you write will have the keyword ``public`` before them though it is
not required. The **class definition** itself always starts with the **keyword** ``class``
followed by the **name** of the class. Then the rest of the class, called the **body**,
is defined inside a pair of ``{ }``s.

Since we’re talking about anatomy, let’s create a class called ``Person``.
Classes are almost always named with _capitalized names_ though this is a matter
of style, not a rule of the language. Here is the basic skeleton of a ``Person``
class:

```java
public class Person
{
    // define class here - also called the “body” of the class

}
```

You can create **instances** of the ``Person`` class with ``new`` as in ``new
Person()`` And you can declare variables that can hold a reference to a
``Person`` object with ``Person variableName``. Put it altogether to **declare some variables** and **initialize** each one with a reference to a new ``Person`` object as shown here:

```java
// Create OBJECTS - instances of the class
Person ada = new Person();
Person charles = new Person();
```

So what makes up the **body** of the class—the stuff between the ``{}``s?

{:.highlight}
Remember that `objects` have both _attributes_ and _behaviors_. These correspond to
**instance variables** and **methods** in the `class` definition.

🧠📚 The first things we define in a class are usually the **instance variables**. They
are called that because each _instance_ of the class (each _object_) has its own set
of variables that aren’t shared with other instances. 
> This is what allowed ``yertle`` and ``myrtle`` from Unit 2 to be at different positions at the same
time; they each had their own x position and y position instance variables.

🏗️🧱 The next thing we define in a class is usually its **constructors**. We’ll talk
about writing constructors in more detail in the next section but a
constructor’s job is to _initialize the instance variables_ when the object is
created. Usually that will mean they need to take **arguments**. 

💃🕺 The real meat of a class is in the **methods** which define the _behaviors_ of the
objects of that class. 
> Recall from Unit 2 that most methods either do things
(like the ``Turtle`` methods that moved the turtle on the screen) or return
values like the ``getXPos`` and ``getYPos`` on ``Turtle``.

The methods of the class **share access to the object’s instance variables** and
when a method is called on an object it uses the instance variables for that
object. 
> For example in the ``Turtle`` class the ``forward`` method changes an
instance variable ``xPos``. When you call ``forward`` on ``yertle`` it changes
``xPos`` on the ``yertle`` object and when you call it on ``myrtle`` it changes
the ``xPos`` on the ``myrtle`` object.

<div class="imp" markdown="block">
    
_Putting it all together, the three main anatomical features of a class are:_

1. The **instance variables** which hold values (_attributes_) associated with each object
2. The **constructors** whose job is to initialize the instance variables for an object
3. The **methods** who contain the code that gives the objects their _behavior_ and which
can use the instance variables defined in the class

```java
public class Person
{
    // 1. INSTANCE VARIABLES

    // 2. CONSTRUCTORS

    // 3. METHODS

}
```

</div>

> ADDITIONALLY, any Java class can have a ``main`` method which can be used to run that class as a
program either to **test** that one class, or sometimes act as the **entry point** to a whole
program made up of many classes and objects.

{:.highlight}
One important question we have to ask when designing a class is, **what data does
it represent**? In this case we can ask, what would we want to _know_ about a
person? Our answer will depend on what problem we are trying to solve. 

> In one program, perhaps an address book, we might want to know the person's name and
phone number and email. In another program, such as a medical application, we
might need to know their vital signs such as their blood pressure, temperature,
and pulse rate.

### Instance Variables

As we’ve said, **instance variables** hold the data for an object. They record what an object _needs to know_ to play its role in the program. 
> Instance variables are also sometimes called **attributes**, **fields**, or **properties**.

🔐 In general and definitely on the AP CSA exam, instance variables should be
declared **private**. Think of ``private`` as like your diary. Only you should
have direct access to it. Similarly, in Java a ``private`` instance variable can
only be accessed by code in the class that declares the variable.

{:.highlight}
**Instance variables** are declared right after the class declaration. They usually start with ``private`` then the *type* of the variable and then a *name* for the variable. Private means only the code in this class has access to it.

The ``Person`` class declares 3 private instance variables: ``name``, ``email``,
and ``phoneNumber``. These are things that you might want to know about a
person. They are declared at the top of the class and they exist inside the ``{
}`` of the class.

Once we have created a class like ``Person``, we can create many **instances**
(_objects_) of the class. The class is like a _blueprint_ or _cookie cutter_ that
defines the variables and methods for that class. Each object will have their
own copies of the _same instance variables_ but with _possibly different values_ in
them (as seen in the cookie decorations below):

![image](Figures/PersonClassWithCookies.png)

> * 💊 Good Java coding style stresses **data encapsulation** where the data (_instance
variables_) and the code acting on the data (_methods_) are wrapped together into a
single unit and the implementation details are **hidden**.
> * Why?? Because only code in the class can access or change the values of ``private`` instance variables, it is a
lot easier to keep track of how your program works than if you had to worry that
any code anywhere in a much larger program could possibly change the values of
the variables.
> * Code in other classes can only interact with the ``public`` methods you provide
and cannot directly access the ``private`` instance variables (_shown in the pink
box above_).
> * When designing a class you get to decide what data to make **accessible** or
**modifiable** from other classes by what ``public`` methods you provide. 

### Methods

Now to **methods** which define what we can actually do with an object. The most
important methods in a class are the ``public`` methods since they can be
accessed from outside the class. You may also write ``private`` methods that are
not accessible outside of the class and therefore can only be used by other
methods inside the same class. As you’ve probably figured out, the ``public``
and ``private`` keywords determine the external access and visibility of
classes, instance variables, constructors, and methods.

{:.important}
**Methods** define what the _object can do_. They typically start with the ``public`` keyword 
then a return type, then the name of the method followed by parentheses for optional parameters. Methods defined for an object can access and use its instance variables!

The ``Person`` class above has a ``print`` method that prints out all the data
stored for a person object. Here is what that **method definition** inside the class file (like peeking into the hood of a car) might look like: 

```java
public void print()
{
    System.out.println("Name: " + name);
    System.out.println("Email: " + email);
    System.out.println("Phone Number: " + phoneNumber);
}
```
> * Notice that this method is marked as ``public``, and after the keyword
``public`` comes the **return type**. The ``void`` return type, as you may recall from Unit 2, is used to indicate that the method does not return anything but has some _effect_ such as printing to the screen.
> * After the return type comes the method **name** followed by parentheses containing the list of **parameters**. In this
case there are no parameters (no _input_ needed for the process) but we still need the ``( )``s.
> * The **body** of the method is in ``{ }``s.
> * As we’ve discussed, the method can access and use the instance variables defined in the class: ``name``, ``email``, and
``phoneNumber`` but will get the values specific to the object we called ``print`` on.

<div class="important" markdown="block">

📣 To **call** (_activate/run/use_) a method, we need to create an object that is an instance of the class such as we
get by calling its constructor. Then we use the **dot** (``.``) **operator** to call its
``public`` methods, for example ``p1.print()`` means call the ``print`` method
on the object ``p1``.

```java
// call the constructor to create a new person
Person p1 = new Person("Sana", "sana@gmail.com", "123-456-7890");
// call p1's print method
p1.print();
```
</div>

### Object-Oriented Design

So far we’ve just talked about designing one class. In **object-oriented
design** (OOD), programmers often start by deciding which **classes** are needed to
solve a problem, and then figure out the **data** and **methods** in each class.

{:.highlight}
When you are given a problem specification, you can identify **classes** you’ll need
by looking for the _nouns_ in the specification. 

🐢 For instance, the specification for the turtle graphics system from Unit 2 probably contained a
sentence that said something like, _“there are turtles that can exist on a
2-dimensional world and can draw lines by moving around the world”_. The main
**nouns** in that description are “turtle” and “world” and indeed the classes in the
system are ``Turtle`` and ``World``.
> (The one noun that was not turned into a
class was “line”. Do you think it would have made sense to create a ``Line``
class? Why or why not?)

Once you’ve determined the classes you need, then you can go through the process
we described above to design the individual classes. 

{:.highlight}
Note that you can often identify **methods** that should exist on classes by looking for _verbs_ in the
specification, like “move”.

#### Drawing Class Diagrams

Sometimes it’s useful, when designing a complex system with lots of classes, to
make **diagrams** of the classes that show you at a glance what instance variables
and methods they have. Often these can just be sketches in your notebook or on a
whiteboard but there are also more formal systems such as the [Unified Modeling
Language (UML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language#:~:text=The%20unified%20modeling%20language%20(UML,the%20design%20of%20a%20system.) for drawing these diagrams.

{:.important}
Here is a [tutorial on class diagrams](https://medium.com/@smagid_allThings/uml-class-diagrams-tutorial-step-by-step-520fd83b300b) that explains it in more detail if you are curious (_drawing class diagrams is not tested on the AP CSA exam_). If you want to draw your own, [app diagrams](https://app.diagrams.net/) or [Creately.com](https://creately.com) are good free online drawing tools for UML class diagrams.

For example, here is a UML class diagram for the ``Turtle`` class. The ``-`` in
front of the attributes indicate that they are private, and the ``+`` in front
of the methods indicate that they are public.

#### 🧠 Check Your Understanding
{:.no_toc}

<div class="task" markdown="block">
    
Say you wanted to make a computer game from a board game that you are playing. Think about what objects are in the game. For example, here is the description for **Monopoly** (trademark Hasbro games):
> "Buy, sell, dream and scheme your way to riches. Players buy, sell and trade to win. Build houses and hotels on your properties and bankrupt your opponents to win it all. Chance and Community Chest cards can change everything." 

What **classes** would you need to create a computer version of this game? (Remember to look for the _nouns_). Take one of the classes you listed, and try to come up with 2 pieces of _data_ in that class that will be the **instance variables**.

## ⭐️ Summary

- Programmers use code to represent a physical object or nonphysical concept,
  real or imagined, by defining a class based on the attributes and/or behaviors
  of the object or concept.

- **Instance Variables** define the attributes or data needed for objects, and
  **methods** define the behaviors or functions of the object.

- **Data encapsulation** is a technique in which the implementation details of a
  class are kept hidden from the user. The data is kept private with access only
  through the public methods that can act on the data in the class.

- The keywords ``public`` and ``private`` affect the access of classes, data,
  constructors, and methods.

- The keyword ``private`` restricts access to the declaring class, while the
  keyword ``public`` allows access from classes outside the declaring class.

- Instance variables are encapsulated by using the ``private`` **access
  modifier**.

- Methods can be ``public`` or ``private``. The set of ``public`` methods define
  what other classes can do with an instance of a class.
