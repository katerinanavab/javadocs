## Searching Algorithms

Computers store vast amounts of data. One of the strengths of computers is their ability to find data _quickly_. This ability is called **searching**. 

For the AP CSA exam you will need to know both **linear (sequential) search** and **binary search** algorithms.

* 🔍➡️ **Sequential/Linear search** typically starts at the _first_ element in an array or ArrayList and looks through _all_ the items one by one until it either:
  * Finds the desired value and then returns the `index` where the value was found. 
  * Or if it searches the entire array or list _without_ finding the value, it returns `-1` (which is an **invalid** index).
* 🔍↔️ **Binary search** can only be used on data that has been _SORTED_ or stored in order. It checks the _middle_ of the data to see if that middle value is less than, equal, or greater than the desired value and then based on the results of that it narrows the search.
  * It cuts the search space in half each time!

> If **binary search** requires the values in an array or list to be *sorted*, how can you do that?  There are many **sorting algorithms** which are covered in the next lesson.


### Sequential/Linear Search

🔍➡️ **Sequential** or **linear** search can be used to find a value in *unsorted* data. It usually starts at the _first_ element and walks through the array or list until it finds the value it is looking for and returns its `index`. 

If it reaches the end of the array or list _without finding_ the value, the search method usually returns a `-1` to show that it didn't find the value in the array or list. 

#### Array
{:.no_toc}

```java
/**
 * Finds the index of a value in an array of integers.
 * @param elements an array containing the items to be searched.
 * @param target the item to be found in elements.
 * @return an index of target in elements if found; -1 otherwise.
*/
public static int sequentialSearch(int[] elements, int target) {
    for (int j = 0; j < elements.length; j++) {
        if (elements[j] == target) {
            return j;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

{:.highlight} 
Many of our examples will use arrays for simplicity since with arrays, we know _how many items_ we have and the _size won't change_ during runtime. 

> There are methods such as ``contains`` that can be used in ArrayLists instead of writing your own algorithms. However, they are not in the AP CSA Java subset.

Below is the same search with an ``ArrayList`` **data structure** instead. The same algorithms can be used with arrays or ``ArrayList``s, but notice that ``size()`` and ``get(i)`` are used with ``ArrayList``s instead of ``length`` and ``[i]`` which are used in arrays. 

#### ArrayList
{:.no_toc}

```java
/**
 * Finds the index of a value in an ArrayList of integers.
 * @param elements an array containing the items to be searched.
 * @param target the item to be found in elements.
 * @return an index of target in elements if found; -1 otherwise.
*/
public static int sequentialSearch(ArrayList<Integer> elements, int target) {
    for (int j = 0; j < elements.size(); j++) {
        if (elements.get(j) == target) {
            return j;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### Binary Search

🔍↔️ How do you search for something in a phone book or dictionary that is in alphabetical or numerical **order**? If you're looking for something beginning with M or on page 100 in a 200 page book, you wouldn't want to start with page 1. You would probably start looking somewhere in the _middle_ of the book. This is the idea behind **binary search**.

{:.highlight}
If your array or list is already in **order** (sorted), binary search will on average find an element or determine that it is missing _much more quickly_ than a linear search. But binary search can only be used if the data is sorted.

Binary search keeps _dividing_ the sorted **search space** into half. It compares a `target` value to the value in the `middle` of a range of indices.  
* If the value isn't found, it looks again in either the `left` or `right` half of the current range.
* Each time through the loop it _eliminates half the values_ in the search area until either the value is found or there is no more data to look at.

See the animation below from [Alvaro Israel on Github](https://github.com/AlvaroIsrael/binary-search):

The code for an _iterative_ ``binarySearch`` below is from the AP CSA course description: 

```java
public static int binarySearch(int[] elements, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = elements.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int middle = (left + right) / 2;
        if (target < elements[middle]) {
            right = middle - 1;
        }
        else if (target > elements[middle]) {
            left = middle + 1;
        }
        else {
            return middle;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
> * Binary search calculates the `middle` index as ``left + right / 2`` where `left` starts out at `0 and `right` starts out at the array `length - 1` (the index of the last element).
> * Remember that _integer division gives an integer result_ so 2.5 becomes 2!
> * It compares the value at the `middle` index with the `target` value (the value you are searching for).
> * If the target value is _less_ than the value at the middle, it sets `right` to middle minus one.
> * If the target value is _greater_ than the value at the middle, it sets `left` to middle plus one.
> * Otherwise, the values match, so it **returns** the `middle` index. It also stops when left is greater than right which indicates that the value wasn't found and it **returns** `-1`.

You can also use binary search with a ``String`` array.  But, when you look for a ``String``, be sure to use ``compareTo`` method rather than ``<`` or ``>`` which can only be used with primitive types.  Remember how the ``String`` method ``compareTo`` works:

   -  **int compareTo(String other)** returns a negative value if the current string is less than the ``other`` string, 0 if they have the same characters in the same order, and a positive value if the current string is greater than the ``other`` string.

```java
public static int binarySearch(String[] elements, String target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = elements.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int middle = (left + right) / 2;
        if (target.compareTo(elements[middle]) < 0) {
            right = middle - 1;
        }
        else if (target.compareTo(elements[middle]) > 0) {
            left = middle + 1;
        }
        else {
            return middle;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### Runtimes

How do we **choose** between two algorithms that solve the same problem? They usually have different characteristics and **runtimes** which measures how fast they run. For the searching problem, it depends on the _size_ of your data.

Binary search is much _faster_ than linear search, especially on large data sets, but it can only be used on _sorted_ data. Often with runtimes, computer scientist think about the **worst case behavior**. With searching, the worst case is usually if you cannot find the item. 
> With linear search, you would have to go through the _whole array_ before realizing that it is not there, but binary search is much faster even in this case because it _eliminates half the data_ set in each step.

⏰ We can measure an informal runtime by just counting the number of steps. Here is a table that compares the **worst case runtime** of each search algorithm given an array of `n` elements:

N | Linear Search | Binary Search
--- | -------- | ------- |
2 | 2 comparisons | 2 comparisons
4 | 4             | 3
8 | 8            | 4
16 | 16          | 5
100 | 100         | 7

> Runtimes can be described with [mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation). You don't need to know the runtime growth functions for the AP exam, but you should be able to **calculate how many steps** binary search takes for a given `n` by counting how many times you can _divide it in half_.

## ⭐️ Summary

- There are standard algorithms for **searching**:
  - **Sequential/linear search** algorithms check each element in order until the desired value is found or all elements in the array or ArrayList have been checked.
  - The **binary search** algorithm starts at the _middle_ of a sorted array or ArrayList and eliminates half of the array or ArrayList in each iteration until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated.

- Data must be in **sorted** order to use the binary search algorithm. This algorithm will be covered more in Unit 10.

- Informal **run-time** comparisons of program code segments can be made using statement execution counts.
