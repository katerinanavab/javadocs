## The String Class


**Strings** in Java are _objects_ of the ``String`` _class_ that hold **sequences of characters** (`a`, `B`, `c`, `$`, etc). You can declare a variable to be of the type ``String``.

> Remember that a **class** (or classification) in Java defines the data that all **objects** of the class have (the _instance variables_) and the behaviors, the things that objects know how to do (the _methods_).

{:.highlight}
Class names in Java, like ``String``, begin with a _CAPITAL_ letter.  All primitive types: ``int``, ``double``, and ``boolean``, begin with a _lowercase_ letter. This is one easy way to tell the difference between primitive types and class types.
